## Downloading and reading files from SharePoint

You can use `download_sp_item()` to download files or folders from SharePoint:


``` r
docx_url <- "https://bmore.sharepoint.com/:w:/r/sites/MayorsOffice-DataGovernance/Policy%20Documents/Data%20Classification%20Standard.docx?d=w54a9ae7eaa894e94b6d6d14516f3aaa4&csf=1&web=1&e=ee7ZSX"

download_sp_item(
  path = docx_url,
  new_path = tempdir()
)
#> Loading Microsoft Graph login for default tenant
#> ℹ Downloading SharePoint item to
#> '/var/folders/3f/50m42dx1…
#> Error: Path exists and overwrite is FALSE
#> ✖ Downloading SharePoint item to '/var/folders/3f/50m42dx1…
```

For files on SharePoint, `read_sharepoint()` extends `download_sp_item()` by downloading the selected item to a temporary folder by default and, depending on the file extension, tries to read the file using `{readr}`, `{readxl}`, `{officer}`, or `{sf}`.


``` r
docx <- read_sharepoint(docx_url)
#> Loading Microsoft Graph login for default tenant
#> ℹ Downloading SharePoint item to '/var/folders/3f/50m42dx1…✔ Downloading SharePoint item to '/var/folders/3f/50m42dx1…
#> ℹ Reading item with `officer::read_docx()`✔ Reading item with `officer::read_docx()` [44ms]
```

``` r

## Writing and uploading files to SharePoint

You can use `upload_sp_item()` to upload a local file to a SharePoint folder or document library.


``` r
folder_url <- "https://bmore.sharepoint.com/:f:/r/sites/MayorsOffice-DataGovernance/Shared%20Documents/RStats?csf=1&web=1&e=S1XxVU"

upload_sp_item(
  file = system.file("gpkg/nc.gpkg", package = "sf"),
  dest = folder_url
)
#> Loading Microsoft Graph login for default tenant
#> ℹ Uploading file 'nc.gpkg' to SharePoint drive✔ File upload complete [1.9s]                 
```

Using `read_sharepoint()`, we can confirm that the file has been uploaded:


``` r
sp_drive <- get_sp_drive(folder_url)
#> Loading Microsoft Graph login for default tenant
```

``` r

nc <- read_sharepoint(
  "RStats/nc.gpkg",
  drive = sp_drive
)
#> ℹ Downloading SharePoint item to
#> '/var/folders/3f/50m42dx1…
#> ✔ Downloading SharePoint item to '/var/folders/3f/50m42dx1…
#> ℹ Reading item with `sf::read_sf()`✔ Reading item with `sf::read_sf()` [27ms]
```

``` r

plot(nc["AREA"])
```

`write_sharepoint()` extends `upload_sp_item()` by allowing you to pass an R object instead of a file path. Like `read_sharepoint()` tries to guess the appropriate input function, `write_sharepoint()` tries to guess the appropriate output function based on the object class.


``` r
write_sharepoint(
  mtcars,
  file = "mtcars.csv",
  dest = folder_url
)
#> Loading Microsoft Graph login for default tenant
#> ℹ Uploading file 'mtcars.csv' to SharePoint drive✔ File upload complete [970ms]                   
```

To wrap up this example, we need to remove the uploaded files from SharePoint to keep a tidy shared file system.

`delete_sp_item()` supports the option to use a shared item URL to select which file to remove but, in this case, it is easier to set the `drive` argument along with a relative filepath:


``` r
# Remove the file
delete_sp_item(
  file.path("RStats", "nc.gpkg"),
  drive = sp_drive,
  confirm = FALSE
)

delete_sp_item(
  file.path("RStats", "mtcars.csv"),
  drive = sp_drive,
  confirm = FALSE
)
```

## Listing files

If you do not know the URL or file path for an item on SharePoint you can also use the directory info functions to list items typically using the `sp_dir_info()` function. This function supports recursive listings but this can be slow depending on the number of items in the SharePoint library.

This last example is not computed but it shows how to list and remove empty nested directories left over from a failed manual import;


``` r
# List directories
dir_info <- sp_dir_info("<SharePoint Folder URL>", type = "directory", recurse = TRUE)

# Filter to empty directories and sort by depth
empty_dirs <- dir_info |>
  filter(size == 0) |>
  mutate(
    path_depth = str_count(name, "/")
  ) |>
  arrange(desc(path_depth))

# Get drive
drive <- get_sp_drive(
  drive_name = "<SharePoint Document Library Name>",
  site_url = "<SharePoint Site URL>"
)

# Delete empty directories and skip confirmation
walk(
  empty_dirs[["id"]],
  \(x) {
    delete_sp_item(
      item_id = x,
      drive = drive,
      confirm = FALSE
    )
  }
)
```

Overall, the intent of this package is to maximize flexibility in how and where you read and write files from SharePoint. Suggestions are welcome so please share your own tips on working with the Microsoft SharePoint API and the `{Microsoft365R}` package.
