## Downloading and reading files from SharePoint

You can use `download_sp_item()` to download files or folders from SharePoint:


``` r
docx_url <- "https://bmore.sharepoint.com/:w:/r/sites/MayorsOffice-DataGovernance/Policy%20Documents/Data%20Classification%20Standard.docx?d=w54a9ae7eaa894e94b6d6d14516f3aaa4&csf=1&web=1&e=ee7ZSX"

download_sp_item(
  path = docx_url,
  new_path = tempdir()
)
#> Loading Microsoft Graph login for default tenant
#> ℹ Downloading SharePoint item to
#> '/var/folders/3f/50m42dx1333_dfqb5772j6_4…
#> Error: Path exists and overwrite is FALSE
#> ✖ Downloading SharePoint item to '/var/folders/3f/50m42dx1333_dfqb5772j6_4…
```

For files on SharePoint, `read_sharepoint()` extends `download_sp_item()` by downloading the selected item to a temporary folder by default and, depending on the file extension, tries to read the file using `{readr}`, `{readxl}`, `{officer}`, or `{sf}`.


``` r
docx <- read_sharepoint(docx_url)
#> Loading Microsoft Graph login for default tenant
#> ℹ Downloading SharePoint item to '/var/folders/3f/50m42dx1333_dfqb5772j6_4…✔ Downloading SharePoint item to '/var/folders/3f/50m42dx1333_dfqb5772j6_4…
#> ℹ Reading item with `officer::read_docx()`✔ Reading item with `officer::read_docx()` [37ms]
```

## Writing and uploading files to SharePoint

You can use `upload_sp_item()` to upload a local file to a SharePoint folder or document library.


``` r
folder_url <- "https://bmore.sharepoint.com/:f:/r/sites/MayorsOffice-DataGovernance/Shared%20Documents/RStats?csf=1&web=1&e=S1XxVU"

upload_sp_item(
  file = system.file("gpkg/nc.gpkg", package = "sf"),
  dest = folder_url
)
#> Loading Microsoft Graph login for default tenant
#> ℹ Uploading file 'nc.gpkg' to SharePoint drive✔ File upload complete [1.1s]                 
```

Using `read_sharepoint()`, we can confirm that the file has been uploaded:


``` r
sp_drive <- get_sp_drive(folder_url)
#> Loading Microsoft Graph login for default tenant
```

``` r

nc <- read_sharepoint(
  "RStats/nc.gpkg",
  drive = sp_drive
)
#> ℹ Downloading SharePoint item to
#> '/var/folders/3f/50m42dx1333_dfqb5772j6_4…
#> ✔ Downloading SharePoint item to '/var/folders/3f/50m42dx1333_dfqb5772j6_4…
#> ℹ Reading item with `sf::read_sf()`✔ Reading item with `sf::read_sf()` [29ms]
```

``` r

plot(nc["AREA"])
```

`write_sharepoint()` extends `upload_sp_item()` by allowing you to pass an R object instead of a file path. Like `read_sharepoint()` tries to guess the appropriate input function, `write_sharepoint()` tries to guess the appropriate output function based on the object class.


``` r
write_sharepoint(
  mtcars,
  file = "mtcars.csv",
  dest = folder_url
)
#> Loading Microsoft Graph login for default tenant
#> ℹ Uploading file 'mtcars.csv' to SharePoint drive✔ File upload complete [1.1s]                    
```

To wrap up this example, we need to remove the uploaded files from SharePoint to keep a tidy shared file system.

`delete_sp_item()` supports the option to use a shared item URL to select which file to remove but, in this case, it is easier to set the `drive` argument along with a relative filepath:


``` r
# Remove the file
delete_sp_item(
  file.path("RStats", "nc.gpkg"),
  drive = sp_drive,
  confirm = FALSE
)

delete_sp_item(
  file.path("RStats", "mtcars.csv"),
  drive = sp_drive,
  confirm = FALSE
)
```
