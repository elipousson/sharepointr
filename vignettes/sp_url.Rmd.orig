```{r setup}
library(sharepointr)
```

This is a folder URL. It is a shared link where people with existing access can use the link.

```{r}
dir_url <- "https://bmore.sharepoint.com/:f:/r/sites/DOP-CPR/Shared%20Documents/INSPIRE%20Program%20%F0%9F%8F%AB%F0%9F%9A%B8%F0%9F%8C%B3?csf=1&web=1&e=W5dbYz"
```

There are a bunch of different types of URLs that SharePoint uses so they don't all work with this package yet. You can parse a URL into smaller parts:

```{r}
sp_url_parse(dir_url)
```

These parts can be used as the `path`, `site_url`, and other parameters can be used to get sites, drives, lists, and items from SharePoint:

```{r}
get_sp_site(dir_url)

get_sp_drive(dir_url)
```

With a directory URL, you can get a list of files:

```{r}
dir_info <- sp_dir_info(dir_url)

dir_info
```

You can use the same URL to get a character vector of file names:

```{r}
sp_dir_ls(dir_url)
```

But you can't use that URL to get a list:

```{r, error=TRUE}
get_sp_list(dir_url)
```

SharePoint lists have two different styles of URLs (that I've seen) and they both work:

```{r}
list_url <- "https://bmore.sharepoint.com/:l:/r/sites/MayorsOffice-DataGovernance/Lists/Data%20Governance%20Progress%20Tracker?e=0P1fFX"

get_sp_list(list_url)
```

The second styles includes the query parameter `env=WebViewList`:

```{r}
"https://bmore.sharepoint.com/sites/MayorsOffice-DataGovernance/Lists/Data%20Governance%20Progress%20Tracker/AllItems.aspx?env=WebViewList"
```

Shared URLs for files work with `get_sp_item()` and `get_sp_item_properties()`:

```{r}
file_url <- "https://bmore.sharepoint.com/:w:/r/sites/DOP-CPR/Shared%20Documents/INSPIRE%20Program%20%F0%9F%8F%AB%F0%9F%9A%B8%F0%9F%8C%B3/INSPIRE%20Plans%20In%20Progress%20%E2%9C%8F%EF%B8%8F/Govans%20ES/Govans%20Final%20Planning%20Document%20and%20related%20materials/Govans%20INSPIRE%20Plan%20-%20Final%20draft%20before%20layout.docx?d=w3408fbc67fa2462187409eb240eb4df2&csf=1&web=1&e=4dcgze"

get_sp_item(file_url)
```

Or you can also use a document URL (as long as the default library is set to match the document library of the supplied URL):

```{r}
document_url <- "https://bmore.sharepoint.com/:w:/r/sites/DOP-CPR/_layouts/15/Doc.aspx?sourcedoc=%7B3408FBC6-7FA2-4621-8740-9EB240EB4DF2%7D&file=Govans%20INSPIRE%20Plan%20-%20Final%20draft%20before%20layout.docx&action=default&mobileredirect=true"

get_sp_item(document_url)
```
